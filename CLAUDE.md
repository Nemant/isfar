# CLAUDE.md — Isfar development guide

Working context for Claude Code. Read this first; it captures the architecture and the rules
that aren't obvious from any single file.

## What this is

A single-page, mobile-first web app that maps the five daily prayers across a flight. **Astro
(static SSG) + one React island + adhan-js**, compiled by Vite. The entire calculator is a single
`client:only="react"` island (the former `#root` tree); `src/pages/index.astro` is the static
shell. Build with `npm run build` (→ `dist/`), preview with `npm run preview`. Babel-in-browser is
gone; `adhan`/`react` are pinned npm deps.

> **History:** an earlier Astro port shipped to prod and was reverted over theme-FOUC / iOS-chrome
> hydration issues. This (second) port deliberately uses **`client:only`** — the island is never
> server-rendered, so there is no hydration mismatch to fight. Don't "optimise" it back to
> `client:load`/SSG without re-reading that history (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-astro-port-design.md`).

## Golden rules

1. **Never hand-roll prayer-time math.** All prayer times come from **adhan-js**. Only expose
   calculation methods adhan actually provides (see `data.js` `METHODS`). Geometry that is NOT
   prayer-calc (great-circle position, qibla bearing, horizon dip, timezone conversion) is ours
   to compute and lives in `engine.js`.
2. **Calm and minimal.** One input, one clear answer. No clutter, no slop, no filler. Reverent,
   not kitschy — lean on light/horizon/sky, never clip-art mosques or crescents.
3. **Dual time zones, equal weight.** Every prayer shows origin + destination time as equals
   (airport codes, not city names; never mix). No "local solar time" — that was removed as
   confusing.
4. **Honest copy.** e.g. the offline note says lookups need signal but saved flights work
   offline — don't overstate.

## File map

All ES modules now use real `import`/`export` (no `window.*` globals). Cross-references resolve at
build time, not load order.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/index.astro` | Static shell + the entire SEO `<head>` (title/meta/OG/Twitter/both JSON-LD blocks via `set:html`/canonical/manifest/icons/font preloads). Mounts `<Calculator client:only="react" />` in `#root`. The pre-paint `<script is:inline>` sets `<html data-theme>` before the island mounts (no FOUC); intentionally **no** `theme-color` meta (see iOS chrome note). |
| `src/lib/data.js` | Named exports: sample flights, `lookup()` (sync, sample table), **`lookupRemote(raw,date)`** (async; calls the live `/api/flight` Worker in prod), `useRemoteApi()` (env switch), `COLOR`, `META`, `METHODS` (12), `GUIDANCE` (qasr/jam'). |
| `src/lib/engine.js` | `compute(raw, {method, madhab})` → display model. All geometry. Imports `adhan` (npm) + `META` from `data.js`. |
| `worker/` | The `isfar-flight` Cloudflare Worker (`/api/flight`): AeroDataBox lookup, `Intl`-derived tz/date, KV cache, daily ceiling. `CONTRACT.md` freezes the response shape (= the `data.js` record). Standalone — **not** ported into Astro. |
| `wrangler.toml` (root) | Config for the **`isfar`** static-asset Worker: assets-only, `[assets] directory="./dist"`. Read by `npx wrangler deploy` after the build. (Separate from `worker/wrangler.toml`.) |
| `scripts/gen-sw-precache.mjs` | Runs after `astro build`; rewrites `dist/sw.js`'s `CORE` list from the build output (hashed asset names never hand-maintained). Fails loudly if its marker is missing. |
| `src/components/Calculator.jsx` | Default-exported island root: `App` state machine + `Landing`/`Loading`/`Results`/`ErrorState`/`NoSunset`. |
| `src/components/tweaks-panel.jsx` | Tweaks shell (theme, accent warmth). Dev `__edit_mode_*` postMessage host bridge removed. |
| `src/components/components.jsx` | Icons (`Ic`), `Header`, sheets (`SettingsSheet`, `GuideSheet`, `MethodSheet`), `FlightSummary`, `TzBanner`, `PlaneQibla`, `NextPrayer`. |
| `src/components/arc.jsx` | `ArcTimeline` — sun-elevation curve, prayer dots, in-flight band, day-break dividers. |
| `src/components/cards.jsx` | `PrayerCard`, `PrayerList` (grouped into Before/In-flight/After sections). |
| `src/styles/styles.css` | All styling. oklch sun-arc palette; `[data-theme=light|dark]` tokens (on `<html>` **and** `.isfar`, so the canvas can read them). Font `@font-face` use root-absolute `/fonts/…`. iOS chrome handling (see note). Imported by `index.astro`. |
| `public/` | Static assets copied verbatim to `dist/` root: `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `favicon.ico`, `icon-*.png`, `og-cover.png`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `fonts/*.woff2`. |

## Conventions (important)

- **ES modules, real imports.** Components are shared via `import`/`export`; Vite resolves them at
  build time, so load order no longer matters. When adding a component, export it and import where
  used (no `window.*`). `adhan`/`react` are npm deps, pinned in `package.json`.
- **Build / preview:** `npm run build` (Astro → `dist/`, then `gen-sw-precache.mjs`) and
  `npm run preview`. There is no test suite — the build (Vite errors on any unresolved import) plus
  Playwright on the preview are the verification oracle.
- **`client:only` island, no SSR.** Reads of `localStorage`/`window`/`navigator` happen only in the
  browser (the island isn't server-rendered), so there's no hydration mismatch to guard against.
- Tweak defaults live in `Calculator.jsx` inside `/*EDITMODE-START*/ … /*EDITMODE-END*/`.
- Persisted state: `localStorage` keys `isfar.settings` (method/madhab), `isfar.theme`
  (`light|dark|auto`), and `isfar.recents`.
- **iOS mobile chrome (don't regress).** The page runs edge-to-edge under iOS Safari's
  *translucent* status/address bars via `viewport-fit=cover`, with content scrolling behind
  them. Keep it that way: (1) **no `<meta theme-color>`** — it forces the bars opaque and kills
  the scroll-behind effect; (2) `.sky` must stay `position: absolute` (scrolls) — `fixed` makes
  iOS force the bars solid; (3) iOS tints *both* safe areas from the single `<html>`
  `background-color` (matched to `--bg-top`) — no element behind the bars can override it, so the
  top/bottom edges can't be different colours; (4) `.col` reserves the safe areas with
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding so content isn't clipped. Theme is set on `<html data-theme>`
  by the inline pre-paint script (in `index.astro`) and kept in sync by `Calculator.jsx`.

## The engine model (`engine.js`)

`compute()` returns `raw` plus: `prayers[]`, `durationMin`, `dep/arr.local`, `cruiseAltFt`,
`multiDay`, and (high-latitude) `noSunset`/`defined`/`undefinedPrayers`.

Each `prayers[]` entry: `{ id, key, en, ar, status (before|inflight|after), t (0..1 sun
fraction), ms, qiblaClock, qiblaRel, sunrise{iata:time}|null, zones{iata:{iata,city,time,date}},
seq }`.

Key internals:
- `greatCircle()` / `initialBearing()` — spherical position + heading.
- crossing detection — walk dep→arr 1-min steps; a prayer is captured when the aircraft clock
  catches its (moving) instant within the flight window. Day-tagged so repeats stay distinct.
- `altDipMinutes(lat, altFt)` — horizon dip; applied to **in-flight Maghrib (later)** and the
  **Fajr-ending sunrise (earlier)** only. Errs slightly late for Maghrib (safe side).
- qibla = `adhan.Qibla(pos)` minus heading → clock position (12 = nose).

## Sample flights (in `src/lib/data.js`)

`SV124` LHR→JED (normal, crosses dusk) · `BA286` codeshare · `QF10` LHR→PER (9 prayers,
2 days, eastbound) · `EK215` DXB→LAX (stretched day, westbound) · `DY394` OSL→TOS
(midnight sun, no-sunset). Any unknown but well-formed code → live Worker lookup in prod
(error state locally). These five are curated demos: they resolve from the **local table even in
production** so their edge cases stay reliable; every other code hits the real API.

## Production / hosting (LIVE — Milestone 1 shipped)

`isfar.app` is served by **two Cloudflare Workers under one domain via Worker Routes** (not Pages):
- **`isfar`** — static-asset Worker, GitHub-connected (Cloudflare "Connect to Git" made a Worker,
  not Pages). **Auto-deploys on every push to `Nemant/isfar` `main`** — that *is* the deploy.
  Serves `isfar.app/*`.
- **`isfar-flight`** — the `/api/flight` backend (`worker/`). Serves `isfar.app/api/*` (more-specific
  route wins). Holds the AeroDataBox key as a Cloudflare secret; KV cache; per-IP rate limit
  (10 req/10s, free-plan cap); daily `CEILING=1000` upstream bill cap.
- `data.js` `useRemoteApi()` picks live API vs. sample table by hostname (`localhost`/`file://` →
  table). Same-origin `/api/flight` ⇒ no CORS and the SW can cache lookups for offline replay.
- **The `isfar` Worker now BUILDS** (since the Astro cutover): its dashboard build command is
  `npm run build` (Astro → `dist/`), deploy command `npx wrangler deploy`, which reads the **root
  `wrangler.toml`** (assets-only, `directory="./dist"`) to upload the build output. A failed build
  keeps the last good deploy live. **To deploy app changes:** push to `main` and the build runs.
  The `worker/` API Worker deploys separately via `wrangler deploy`. Operational ids/secrets: see
  the `isfar-cloud-infra` memory.

## Verifying changes

`npm run build && npm run preview`, open the preview URL, click a sample chip, watch the console
(the build itself fails on any unresolved import). The blurry horizontal band in html-to-image
screenshots is a **capture artifact with `backdrop-filter`**, not a real bug — confirm layout via
DOM/`getBoundingClientRect` or a real pixel screenshot if unsure. Note: non-sample live lookups
need the `/api/flight` Worker, so they only work in prod (or via `wrangler dev`), not the static
preview — the curated sample chips resolve from the local table everywhere.

## Known follow-ups

- ~~Wire a real flight API~~ ✅ done (live `/api/flight` Worker + `lookupRemote`).
- ~~Astro port (drop Babel, ES modules, build step)~~ ✅ done (Phase C). **Next major work:** Phase D
  — SEO build-out (programmatic route/guide pages, i18n) → see `ROADMAP.md`.
- Read true cruise altitude per flight instead of the 38,000 ft default.
- Worker date resolution is "today UTC + first matching segment"; implement true "next departure ≥ now".
- ~~Regenerate `og-cover.png` in Newsreader~~ ✅ done. ~~Self-host fonts~~ ✅ done (`public/fonts/` +
  `@font-face` in `styles.css`).
- Optional: live "current/next prayer" highlight already exists via `NextPrayer`.
